# Mod4-API_Quiz

I am tasked to create and take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

* It is done when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.

* It is done when the game is over, I can save my initials and score.//Got an append error. Scores would save in a list but would not allow a new game to start//
